      <description>Disclaimer: This serie is my notes while I&amp;rsquo;m exploring ReactNative and Clojurescript ecosystems. I&amp;rsquo;ve never done any mobile development or anything related to XCode. I&amp;rsquo;ve done some Clojurescript developments and this is my first time using shadow-cljs.
 TLDR; Create the project I installed npm, yarn, react-native-cli, XCode, shadow-cljs, and used the following commands to create the project.
react-native init FunanMobile cd FunanMobile yarn add --dev shadow-cljs mkdir -p cljs/hello vim cljs/hello/core.</description>

      <description>401 “Unauthorized” really means unauthenticated. You need valid credentials for me to respond to this request.
403 “Forbidden” really means unauthorized. I understand your credentials, but sorry, you’re not allowed.

      <guid>https://darongmean.com/post/deal-with-liferay-friendly-url-mapping/</guid>
      <description>Liferay has default url start with /web, /group and /user to identify if the page is public, private, or user’s private. The mappings can be changed by modify file portal-ext.properties and ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml.
portal-ext.properties  Note: company.default.home.url is set so that Liferay won’t try to open url /web/guest on startup.
 ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml I’ve got weird error after edit web.xml and Liferay startup with errors. Try to delete temp and work folder of tomcat help resolve this issue.</description>

Find which commit delete the file git log -- docroot/user_bars/logo.png # show all changes of a file, work even if the file is deleted git log -1 -- docroot/user_bars/logo.png # limit the output of Git log to the last commit, i.e. the commit which delete the file; -1 to see only the last commit, use -2 to see the last 2 commits etc.</description>

Using target=”_blank” will instruct the browser to create a new browser tab or window when the user clicks on the link.
Using target=”_new” is technically invalid according to the specifications, but as far as I know every browser will behave the same way: - it will search for a tab or window with the context name “_new” - if a “_new” tab/window is found, then the URL is loaded into it - if it’s not found, a new tab/window is created with the context name “_new”, and the URL loaded into it</description>

      <title>Hell with Java Autobox or Why not use instanceof</title>

      <description>I spent few days debugging problem; the following code not work
long[] organizationIds = new long[organizations.size()]; userParams.put(“usersGroups”, organizationIds); but this worked
Long[] organizationIds = new Long[organizations.size()]; why? there’s code check snippet along the line:
if (params.get(“usersGroups”) instanceof Long) Although compiler will allow use long instead of Long and vice visa via autobox, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen with instanceof operator.</description>

      <description>In Java Use abstract class.
See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9975836/howto-simulate-haskells-either-a-b-in-java
In Clojure Use vector. [:left …] and [:right ..] to model either type.
I can pattern match on first element in the vector.
In Haskell Use algebraic data types.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a great post about using clojure with docker. I followed the post with a twist. I used boot-alpine image[1] and docker-compose instead of Vagrant.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the final configuration that worked.
# file docker-compose.yml version: &#39;2&#39; services: bootclj: command: boot dev image: clojure:boot-alpine ports: - 9007:9007 - 9009:9009 - 9011:9011 - 3000:3000 volumes_from: - m2 working_dir: /opt/src m2: command: echo &amp;quot;m2 container ready!&amp;quot; image: alpine volumes: - /root/.m2 - .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got interested into flame graph and gone through an excellent post Java Flame Graphs Introduction: Fire For Everyone!
I tried the following script:
for i in {1..100}; do jstack &amp;lt;pid&amp;gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; iloveoldshit.jstk; sleep 0.1; done cat iloveoldshit.jstk | ./stackcollapse-jstack.pl | ./flamegraph.pl --color=green &amp;gt; jstack-flames.svg and get the following error:
ERROR: No stack counts found Being a beginner, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened. So I decided to go through source code.</description>

      <description>Forget To-Do Lists, What You Really Need Are Anti-To-Do Lists   When researching 11 companies that suddenly went from average to outstanding, Jobs found that the single binding factor between them was the shift in exactly how big decisions were made. The strategy became what not to do rather than what to do.
  BeckDesignRules   Kent Beck came up with his four rules of simple design while he was developing ExtremeProgramming in the late 1990&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
