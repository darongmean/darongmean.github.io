<blockquote>
<p>The best way to manage marketing calendars is to set   your marketing hype cycle one cycle behind your development cycle.</p>
<p>Market only finished products: No missed deadlines. No cut corners. No exploding products. No bad press.</p>
<p>How do you answer &ldquo;When will it ship?&rdquo;
&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of “When will it ship?” the new questions are “what did we ship this week, and how do we want to market it?” Do you hold the new features behind a feature flag system and wait for a marketing calendar event to roll them out to the masses? Do you enable the features right away?</p>
